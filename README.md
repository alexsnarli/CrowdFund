# CrowdFund

Decentralized application for a blockchain based crowdfunding platform.

To use your own infura endpoint, your metamask account and your deployed smart contract, you need to update your endpoint link, account mnemonic and smart contract address in the `next.config_example.js` file, and rename it to `next.config.js`. When using the process.env variables, you need to install "dotenv" first, by using this command with npm:

```
npm install dotenv --save
```
